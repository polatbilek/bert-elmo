Anarchism is an anti-authoritarian political philosophy that rejects hierarchies deemed unjust and advocates their replacement with self-managed, self-governed societies based on voluntary, cooperative institutions
These institutions are often described as stateless societies, although several authors have defined them more specifically as distinct institutions based on non-hierarchical or free associations
Anarchism's central disagreement with other ideologies is that it holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful
Anarchism is usually placed on the far-left of the political spectrum, and much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, collectivism, syndicalism, mutualism, or participatory economics
As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview, many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely
Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism
Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism, or similar dual classifications

The etymological origin of the word anarchism is from the ancient Greek word anarkhia,  meaning "without a ruler", composed of the prefix a- (i.e "without") and the word arkhos (i.e "leader" or "ruler")
The suffix -ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy
The word anarchism appears in English from 1642 as anarchisme and the word anarchy from 1539
Various factions within the French Revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists, although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists
Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as William Godwin (1756–1836) and Wilhelm Weitling (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs
The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist (anarchiste) was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century
Since the 1890s and beginning in France, the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States
On the other hand, some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as libertarian anarchism
While opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of talk among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently
Hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing authority and [organization] (including the state,  capitalism,  nationalism and all associated institutions) in the conduct of all [relations] in favour of a society based on voluntary association, on freedom and on decentralisation, but this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an a posteriori conclusion)
Nonetheless, major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following:
The will for a non-coercive society
The rejection of the state apparatus
The belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society
A suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy

During the prehistoric era of mankind, an established authority did not exist
It was after the creation of towns and cities that hierarchy was invented and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction
Most notable examples of anarchism in the ancient world were in China and Greece
In China, philosophical anarchism, meaning peaceful delegitimizing of the state, was delineated by Taoist philosophers (i.e Zhuangzi and Lao Tzu)
Likewise in Greece, anarchist attitudes were articulated by tragedians and philosophers
Aeschylus and Sophocles used the myth of Antigone to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal autonomy
Socrates questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted to the right of individual freedom of consciousness
Cynics dismissed human law (Nomos) and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (physis)
Stoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state
During the Middle Ages, there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the Islamic world or in Christian Europe
This kind of tradition later gave birth to religious anarchism
In Persia, a Zoroastrian Prophet known as Mazdak was calling for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy, but he soon found himself executed by the king
In Basra, religious sects preached against the state
In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies
Those currents were the precursor of religious anarchism in the centuries to come
It was in the Renaissance and with the spread of reasoning and [through Europe that libertarian ideas emerged
Writers were outlining in their novels ideal societies that were based not on coercion but voluntarism

Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior
Parents usually notice signs during the first three years of their child's life
These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace before worsening
Autism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors
Risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections, such as rubella, toxins including valproic acid, alcohol, cocaine, pesticides and air pollution, fetal growth restriction, and autoimmune diseases
Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypothesis, which has been disproven
Autism affects information processing in the brain and how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood
In the DSM-5, autism and less severe forms of the condition, including Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), have been combined into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
Early behavioral interventions or speech therapy can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills
Although there is no known cure, there have been cases of children who recovered
Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some are successful
An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder
Globally, autism is estimated to affect 24.8 million people 
In the 2000s, the number of people affected was estimated at 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide
In the developed countries, about 1.5% of children are diagnosed with ASD 
from 0.7% in 2000 in the United States
It occurs four-to-five times more often in males than females
The number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the 1960s, which may be partly due to changes in diagnostic practice
The question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved

Autism is a highly variable, neurodevelopmental disorder whose symptoms first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without remission
People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal, or even superior, in others
Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form
It is distinguished by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, and repetitive behavior
Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis
Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits

Social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders (ASD; see Classification) from other developmental disorders
People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted
Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals, or people with normal neural development, as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars"
Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood
Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name
Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things
Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others
However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers
Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD
Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions
Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone
Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism
For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel
Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply
There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD
The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and meltdowns

About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs
Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver
In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words
Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns
Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD
For example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience
Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language
In a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling
Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference
As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends

Autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows
Stereotyped behaviors: Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking
Compulsive behaviors: Time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order, checking things, or hand washing
Sameness: Resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted
Ritualistic behavior: Unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual
This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors
Restricted interests: Interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game
Self-injury: Behaviors such as eye-poking, skin-picking, hand-biting and head-banging
No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors

Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family
An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants
Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population
Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders
Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements)
An estimated 60–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper
Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator
Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur
Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress
Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship
However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults
There is tentative evidence that autism occurs more frequently in people with gender dysphoria
Gastrointestinal problems are one of the most commonly associated medical disorders in people with autism
These are linked to greater social impairment, irritability, behavior and sleep problems, language impairments and mood changes

It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms
However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur
Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants
Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression
Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents
Studies of twins suggest that [is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population
However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified
Typically, autism cannot be traced to a

Albedo () (albedo, meaning 'whiteness') is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation received by an astronomical body (e.g a planet like Earth)
It is dimensionless and measured (via an albedometer) on a scale from 0 (corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation) to 1 (corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation)
Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity to the irradiance (flux per unit area) received by a surface
The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface
These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see position of the Sun)
While bi-hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e, for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period
The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages
Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation
Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm)
This spectrum includes visible light (0.4–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g, trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g, snow reflects most radiation)
Albedo is an important concept in climatology, astronomy, and environmental management (e.g, as part of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings)
The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its planetary albedo, is 30–35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features
The term albedo was introduced into optics by Johann Heinrich Lambert in his 1760 work Photometria

Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances
Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body
When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms
Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4
The average albedo of Earth is about 0.3
This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds
Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA's MODIS instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites, and the CERES instrument on the Suomi NPP and JPSS
As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g,)
These calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle
BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo
Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15&nbsp;°C
If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40&nbsp;°C
If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0&nbsp;°C
In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water – a so-called ocean planet – the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27&nbsp;°C

For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle θi can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms:
the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, {\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}, sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo, and
the bi-hemispherical reflectance, \bar (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:
= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar
This formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface

The albedos of planets, satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties
The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry
For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos
For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids
Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.99
Another notable high-albedo body is Eris, with an albedo of 0.96
Many small objects in the outer Solar System and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 0.05
A typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 0.04
Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds
The overall albedo of the Moon is measured to be around 0.14, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect
Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless Solar System bodies
Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) geometric albedo (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the Bond albedo (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected)
Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion
In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five Hapke parameters which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle, including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces
The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, absolute magnitude and diameter is:
A =\left ( \frac \right ) ^2,
where A is the astronomical albedo, D is the diameter in kilometers, and H is the absolute magnitude

Albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth's surface at that location (e.g through melting of reflective ice)
That said, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude
Albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics

The intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation, whereas areas such as the Sahara Desert, which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation
Tropical and sub-tropical rainforest areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts, which have lower insolation
Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes
Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the Earth
This has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space
This feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect

Albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs
The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive weather

When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature feedback results
A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling
In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g, a warm air mass), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback
However, because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher insolation) cause melting
When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating

Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow
Over Antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8
If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo positive feedback)
Just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water
Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow
When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases
The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts
As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback
Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important to the modern theory of Global warming
Cryoconite, powdery windblown dust containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets
The dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates
Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too
In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing

Albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices
For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions
Research showed impacts of over 10%
More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications

Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation)
In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect
Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration
The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds
Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate
In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily
Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15
Variation in summer albedo across both forest types is correlated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy
The result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy
Studies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests
They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g, Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming

Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials
The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations (see graph)
At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner (not diffusely)
The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this
At small angles of incident light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle
Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles)
However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction
Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light
Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities
Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection
Snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9

Cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures
Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8
"On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water
Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth."
Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic
A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&nbsp;°C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies

Aerosols (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance
The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain
As per Spracklen et al
the effects are:
Aerosol direct effect
Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation
The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming
Aerosol indirect effect
Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei
Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (first indirect effect), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (second indirect effect)

Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles
The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m−2, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m−2
Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo

Human activities (e.g, deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe
However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult

Single-scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles
It depends on properties of the material (refractive index); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation

A or a (named , plural As, A's, as, a's or aes) is the first letter and the first vowel of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet
It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives
The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar
The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ
The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type
In the English grammar, "a", and its variant "an", is an indefinite article

The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is aleph (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet, which consisted entirely of consonants (for that reason, it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet)
In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto-Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended
By 1600 BC, the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms
Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the Paleo-Hebrew or Arabic aleph

When the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages, and that was the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha
In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages, dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set
The Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the Italian Peninsula and left the letter unchanged
The Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write the Latin language, and the resulting letter was preserved in the Latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages, including English

During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter "A"
First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other "permanent" media
There was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces
Due to the "perishable" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as majuscule cursive, minuscule cursive, and semicursive minuscule
Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles
The known variants include the early semi-uncial, the uncial, and the later semi-uncial
At the end of the Roman Empire (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe
Among these were the semicursive minuscule of Italy, the Merovingian script in France, the Visigothic script in Spain, and the Insular or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain
By the 9th century, the Caroline script, which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press
This form was derived through a combining of prior forms
15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today
These variants, the Italic and Roman forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version
The Italic form, also called script a, is used in most current [and consists of a circle and vertical stroke
This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter

The oldest city is Mobile, founded by French colonists in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana
From the American Civil War until World War II, Alabama, like many states in the southern U.S., suffered economic hardship, in part because of its continued dependence on agriculture
Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed Jim Crow laws to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against African Americans from the end of the Reconstruction Era up until at least the 1970s
Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, white rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s
During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented
Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests
The state's economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology

The European-American naming of the Alabama River and state was derived from the Alabama people, a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river
In the Alabama language, the word for a person of Alabama lineage is Albaamo (or variously Albaama or Albàamo in different dialects; the plural form is Albaamaha)
The suggestion that "Alabama" was borrowed from the Choctaw language is unlikely
The word's spelling varies significantly among historical sources
The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540: Garcilaso de la Vega used Alibamo, while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote Alibamu and Limamu, respectively, in transliterations of the term
As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the Alibamon, with French maps identifying the river as Rivière des Alibamons
Other spellings of the name have included Alibamu, Alabamo, Albama, Alebamon, Alibama, Alibamou, Alabamu, Allibamou
Sources disagree on the word's meaning
Some scholars suggest the word comes from the Choctaw alba (meaning "plants" or "weeds") and amo (meaning "to cut", "to trim", or "to gather")
The meaning may have been "clearers of the thicket" or "herb gatherers", referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants
The state has numerous place names of Native American origin
However, there are no correspondingly similar words in the Alabama language
An 1842 article in the Jacksonville Republican proposed it meant "Here We Rest."
This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek
Experts in the Muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation

Indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization
Trade with the northeastern tribes by the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period (1000&nbsp;BC–AD&nbsp;700) and continued until European contact
The agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 AD, with one of its major centers built at what is now the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville, Alabama
This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after Cahokia in present-day Illinois, which was the center of the culture
Analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars' formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC)
Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture, but developed independently
The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood
Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Cherokee, an Iroquoian language people; and the Muskogean-speaking Alabama (Alibamu), Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Koasati
While part of the same large language family, the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages

With exploration in the 16th century, the Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama
The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through Mabila and other parts of the state in 1540
More than 160 years later, the French founded the region's first European settlement at Old Mobile in 1702
The city was moved to the current site of Mobile in 1711
This area was claimed by the French from 1702 to 1763 as part of La Louisiane
After the French lost to the British in the Seven Years' War, it became part of British West Florida from 1763 to 1783
After the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War, the territory was divided between the United States and Spain
The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13, 1813
Thomas Bassett, a loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile
He settled in the Tombigbee District during the early 1770s
The district's boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the Tombigbee River and included portions of what is today southern Clarke County, northernmost Mobile County, and most of Washington County
What is now the counties of Baldwin and Mobile became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783, part of the independent Republic of West Florida in 1810, and was finally added to the Mississippi Territory in 1812
Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period
It was claimed by the Province of Georgia from 1767 onwards
Following the Revolutionary War, it remained a part of Georgia, although heavily disputed
With the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798
The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the Yazoo land scandal
Spain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the Adams–Onís Treaty officially ceded it to the United States in 1819

Before Mississippi's admission to statehood on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the Alabama Territory
The United States Congress created the Alabama Territory on March 3, 1817
St. Stephens, now abandoned, served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819
Alabama was admitted as the 22nd state on December 14, 1819, with Congress selecting Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention
From July 5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution
Huntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of government moved to Cahaba in Dallas County
Cahaba, now a ghost town, was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825
The Alabama Fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the Union, with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation
Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men
Southeastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in Alabama expanded
The economy of the central Black Belt (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton plantations whose owners' wealth grew mainly from slave labor
The area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers
Alabama had an estimated population of under 10,000 people in 1810, but it increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830
Most Native American tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in 1830
From 1826 to 1846, Tuscaloosa served as Alabama's capital
On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery
The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847
A new capitol building was erected under the direction of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia
The first structure burned down in 1849, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851
This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day
It was designed by Barachias Holt of Exeter, Maine

By 1860, the population had increased to 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080, were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were free people of color
On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its secession from the Union
After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the Confederate States of America
The Confederacy's capital was initially at Montgomery
Alabama was heavily involved in the American Civil War
Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort
A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama, joined Nathan Bedford Forrest's battalion in Hopkinsville, Kentucky
The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coat tails
This led to them being greeted with "Yellowhammer", and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army
Alabama's slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865
Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868
From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state
Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: Jeremiah Haralson, Benjamin S. Turner, and James T. Rapier
Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton
During Reconstruction, state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 that created the state's first public school system and expanded women's rights
Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation
Organized insurgent, resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans
Besides the short-lived original Ku Klux Klan, these included the Pale Faces, Knights of the White Camellia, Red Shirts, and the White League
Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence
They wrote another constitution in 1875, and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment, prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools
The same year, legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools
Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891
After disfranchising most African Americans and many poor whites in the 1901 constitution, the Alabama legislature passed more Jim Crow laws at the beginning of the 20th century to impose segregation in everyday life

The new 1901 Constitution of Alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor whites, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a poll tax and literacy test
The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools
By 1903, only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were literate
This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900
The numbers dropped even more in later decades
The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945
While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax
By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African-Americans
Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote
Despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement
The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens
The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes
Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the Rosenwald Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools
In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs
The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest
Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas
They often donated land and labor as well
Beginning in 1913, the first 80 Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama for African-American children
A total of 387 schools, seven teachers' houses, and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state
Several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places
Continued racial discrimination and lynchings, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South
Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see "historical populations" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920
At the same time, many rural people migrated to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs
Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the "Magic City"
By 1920, Birmingham was the 36th-largest city in the United States
Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy
Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes, as it was required by the state constitution
This did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order
Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war
Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living
One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile
Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war-related industries
Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base
Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses
They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas
One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services
Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature
A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, "a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature."
In the United States Supreme Court cases of Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the court ruled ruled that the principle of "one man, one vote" needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well, and that their districts had to be based on population, rather than geographic counties, as Alabama had used for its senate
In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census
This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years
Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts
African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges
In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply
During the 1960s, under Governor George Wallace, Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation
The civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama, including the Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955–56), Freedom Rides in 1961, and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches
These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the U.S. Congress
Legal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but Jim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court
According to The New York Times, by 2017, many of Alabama's African-Americans were living in Alabama's cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery
Also, the Black Belt region across central Alabama "is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly African-American
These counties include Dallas, Lowndes, Marengo and Perry."
Alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation
In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, Dillard v. Crenshaw County, challenged the at-large voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards
At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats
Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions
As part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including Chilton County, adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions
This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters
In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in Conecuh County
In 1982, limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County
Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens

Alabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with  of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States
About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico
The North Alabama region is mostly mountainous, with the Tennessee River cutting a large valley and creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes
Alabama is bordered by the states of Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida to the south, and Mississippi to the west
Alabama has coastline at the Gulf of Mexico, in the extreme southern edge of the state
The state ranges in elevation from sea level at Mobile Bay to over 1,800&nbsp;feet (550&nbsp;m) in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast
The highest point is Mount Cheaha, at a height of 
Alabama's land consists of  of forest or 67% of total land area
Suburban Baldwin County, along the Gulf Coast, is the largest county in the state in both land area and water area
Areas in Alabama administered by the National Park Service include Horseshoe Bend National Military Park near Alexander City; Little River Canyon National Preserve near Fort Payne; Russell Cave National Monument in Bridgeport; Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site in Tuskegee; and Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site near Tuskegee
Additionally, Alabama has four National Forests: Conecuh, Talladega, Tuskegee, and William B. Bankhead
Alabama also contains the Natchez Trace Parkway, the Selma To Montgomery National Historic Trail, and the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail
Notable natural wonders include: the "Natural Bridge" rock, the longest natural bridge east of the Rockies, located just south of Haleyville; Cathedral Caverns in Marshall County, named for its cathedral-like appearance, features one of the largest cave entrances and stalagmites in the world; Ecor Rouge in Fairhope, the highest coastline point between Maine and Mexico; DeSoto Caverns in Childersburg, the first officially recorded cave in the United States; Noccalula Falls in Gadsden features a 90-foot waterfall; Dismals Canyon near Phil Campbell, home to two waterfalls, six natural bridges and allegedly served as a hideout for legendary outlaw Jesse James; Stephens Gap Cave in Jackson County boasts a 143-foot pit, two waterfalls and is one of the most photographed wild cave scenes in America; Little River Canyon near Fort Payne, one of the nation's longest mountaintop rivers; Rickwood Caverns near Warrior features an underground pool, blind cave fish and 260 million year old limestone formations; and the Walls of Jericho canyon on the Alabama-Tennessee state line
A -wide meteorite impact crater is located in Elmore County, just north of Montgomery
This is the Wetumpka crater, the site of "Alabama's greatest natural disaster."
A -wide meteorite hit the area about 80&nbsp;million years ago
The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme ("star-wound") because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface
In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as the 157th recognized impact crater on Earth

The state is classified as [subtropical climate|humid subtropical] (Cfa) under the Koppen Climate Classification
The average annual temperature is 64&nbsp;°F (18&nbsp;°C)
Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler
Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year
Alabama receives an average of  of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300&nbsp;days in the southern part of the state
Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over  throughout the summer in some parts of the state
Alabama is also prone to tropical storms and even hurricanes
Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken
South Alabama reports many thunderstorms
The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported
This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60&nbsp;days per year
Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large [the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm
Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita
Alabama, along with Oklahoma and Iowa, has the most confirmed F5 and EF5 tornadoes of any state, according to statistics from the National Climatic Data Center for the period January 1, 1950, to June 2013
Several long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities since 1950 than any other state
The state was affected by the 1974 Super Outbreak and was devastated tremendously by the 2011 Super Outbreak
The 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state
The tally reached 62
The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state
Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December, along with the spring severe weather season
The northern part of the state—along the Tennessee Valley—is one of the areas in the U.S. most vulnerable to violent tornadoes
The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as Dixie Alley, as distinct from the Tornado Alley of the Southern Plains
Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the Southeastern United States, with average January low temperatures around  in Mobile and around  in Birmingham
Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years
Historic snowfall events include New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm and the 1993 Storm of the Century
The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is  per year
In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall
Alabama's highest temperature of  was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of Centerville
The record low of  occurred on January 30, 1966, in New Market

Alabama is home to a diverse array of flora and fauna, due largely to a variety of habitats that range from the Tennessee Valley, Appalachian Plateau, and Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians of the north to the Piedmont, Canebrake, and Black Belt of the central region to the Gulf Coastal Plain and beaches along the Gulf of Mexico in the south
The state is usually ranked among the top in nation for its range of overall biodiversity
Alabama is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and once boasted huge expanses of pine forest, which still form the largest proportion of forests in the state
It currently ranks fifth in the nation for the diversity of its flora
It is home to nearly 4,000 pteridophyte and spermatophyte plant species
Indigenous animal species in the state include 62 mammal species, 93 reptile species, 73 amphibian species, roughly 307 native freshwater fish species, and 420 bird species that spend at least part of their year within the state
Invertebrates include 97 crayfish species and 383 mollusk species
113 of these mollusk species have never been collected outside the state

The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Alabama was 4,887,871 on July 1, 2018, which represents an increase of 108,135 or 2.26%, since the 2010 Census
This includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 people (that is 502,457 births minus 381,403 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 people into the state
Immigration from outside the U.S. resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people
The state had 108,000 foreign-born (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22.2% were undocumented (24,000)
The center of population of Alabama is located in Chilton County, outside the town of Jemison

According to the 2010 Census, Alabama had a population of 4,779,736
The racial composition of the state was 68.5% White (67.0% Non-Hispanic White and 1.5% Hispanic White), 26.2% Black or African American, 3.9% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 1.1% Asian, 0.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 2.0% from Some Other Race, and 1.5% from Two or More Races
In 2011, 46.6% of Alabama's population younger than age 1 were minorities
The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama are: African (26.2%), English (23.6%), Irish (7.7%), German (5.7%), and Scots-Irish (2.0%)
Those citing "American" ancestry in Alabama are generally of English or British ancestry; many Anglo-Americans identify as having American ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long, in some cases since the 1600s
Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and that the figure is likely higher
In the 1980 census, 41% of the people in Alabama identified as being of English ancestry, making them the largest ethnic group at the time
Based on historic migration and settlement patterns in the southern colonies and states, demographers estimated there are more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than self-reported
Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term Scots-Irish but, based on historic immigration and settlement, their ancestors were more likely Protestant Scots-Irish coming from northern Ireland, where they had been for a few generations as part of the English colonization
The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed
In 1984, under the Davis–Strong Act, the state legislature established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission
Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination
Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected
In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black
The state has officially recognized nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast
These are:
Poarch Band of Creek Indians (who also have federal recognition),
MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians,
Star Clan of Muscogee Creeks,
Echota Cherokee Tribe of Alabama,
Cherokee Tribe of Northeast Alabama,
Cher-O-Creek Intra Tribal Indians,
Ma-Chis Lower Creek Indian Tribe,
Piqua Shawnee Tribe, and
Ani-Yun-Wiya Nation
The state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day

95.1% of all Alabama residents five years old or older spoke only English at home in 2010, a minor decrease from 96.1% in 2000
Alabama English is predominantly Southern, and is related to South Midland speech which was taken across the border from Tennessee
In the major Southern speech region, there is the decreasing loss of the final /r/, for example the /boyd/ pronunciation of 'bird'
In the northern third of the state, there is a South Midland 'arm' and 'barb' rhyming with 'form' and 'orb'
Unique words in Alabama English include: redworm (earthworm), peckerwood (woodpecker), snake doctor and snake feeder (dragonfly), tow sack (burlap bag), plum peach (clingstone), French harp (harmonica), and dog irons (andirons)
In the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey, 86% of Alabama respondents reported their religion as Christian, including 6% Catholic, with 11% as having no religion
The composition of other traditions is 0.5% Mormon, 0.5% Jewish, 0.5% Muslim, 0.5% Buddhist, and 0.5% Hindu
Alabama is located in the middle of the Bible Belt, a region of numerous Protestant Christians
Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the United States, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly
A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant
, the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the Southern Baptist Convention, The United Methodist Church, and non-denominational Evangelical Protestant
In Alabama, the Southern Baptist Convention has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the United Methodist Church with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents
Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the Great Awakening of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South
The Assemblies of God had almost 60,000 members, the Churches of Christ had nearly 120,000 members
The Presbyterian churches, strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants, had a combined membership around 75,000 (PCA – 28,009 members in 108 congregations, PC(USA) – 26,247 members in 147 congregations, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church – 6,000 members in 59 congregations, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America – 5,000 members and 50 congregations plus the EPC and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and 9 congregations)
In a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian Gospels
Of those who indicated a religious preference, 59% said they possessed a "full understanding" of their faith and needed no further learning
In a 2007 poll, 92% of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state
Although in much smaller numbers, many other religious faiths are represented in the state as well, including Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, the Bahá'í Faith, and Unitarian Universalism
Jews have been present in what is now Alabama since 1763, during the colonial era of Mobile, when Sephardic Jews immigrated from London
The oldest Jewish congregation in the state is Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim in Mobile
It was formally recognized by the state legislature on January 25, 1844
Later immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries tended to be Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Europe

The foundational document for Alabama's government is the Alabama Constitution, which was ratified in 1901
At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is by some accounts the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the United States Constitution
There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution
Critics argue that Alabama's constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands
Most counties do not have home rule
Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum
One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism
Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches
The legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature, a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House of Representatives, with 105 members, and the Alabama Senate, with 35 members
The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation
The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature
The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto)
Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county
It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented
It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either
In Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of "one man, one vote", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.)
Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems
At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts
This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas
For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding
Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments
The executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws
It is headed by the governor of Alabama
Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the lieutenant governor of Alabama, the attorney general of Alabama, the Alabama secretary of state, the Alabama state treasurer, and the state auditor of Alabama
The current governor of the state is Republican Kay Ivey
The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections
Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January
The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the state's Constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases
The state's highest court is the Supreme Court of Alabama
Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges
Since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized
The current chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican Tom Parker
All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party
There are two intermediate appellate courts, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four trial courts: the circuit court (trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts
Some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions
Alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country
In some years, it imposes more death sentences than does Texas, a state which has a population five times larger
Some of its cases have been highly controversial; the Supreme Court has overturned 24 convictions in death penalty cases
It was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence; in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole (LWOP) that were voted unanimously by juries
This judicial authority was removed in April 2017

Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent personal income tax, depending upon the amount earned and filing status
Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, and can do so even if taking the standard deduction
Taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (Social Security and Medicare tax)
The state's general sales tax rate is 4%
Sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases
For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay an 11% tax on a meal
, sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide
Alabama is one of seven states that levy a tax on food at the same rate as other goods, and one of two states (the other being neighboring Mississippi) which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low-income families
(Most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate.)
Alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the United States
Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line
Alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes
The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%
The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country
Property taxes are the lowest in the U.S
The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes
Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure
For example, in 2003, Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670&nbsp;million

Alabama has 67 counties
Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission
It also has limited executive authority in the county
Because of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [rule]
Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning
The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [rule] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission
Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county
United States Supreme Court decisions in Baker v. Carr (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of "one man, one vote"
Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties
The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas
"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution
Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city
A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance."
Alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state, meaning that the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol
The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state
Twenty-five of the 67 counties are "dry counties" which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales

During Reconstruction following the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope
In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation
After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution
Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites
By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000
The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law
From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas
As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation
Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform
Governor George Wallace, the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation
Only after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights
In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections
Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single-member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards
In 2007, the Alabama Legislature passed, and Republican governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing "profound regret" over slavery and its lingering impact
In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the Alabama State Capitol, which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America
In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years
, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state

With the disfranchisement of Blacks in 1901, the state became part of the "Solid South", a system in which the Democratic Party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state
For nearly 100&nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with generally only token Republican challengers running in the General Election
Since the mid to late 20th century, however, there has been a realignment among the two major political parties, and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party
In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office
Members of the nine seats on the Supreme Court of Alabama and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office
Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats
In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, Ernest C. Hornsby, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican Perry O. Hooper, Sr.. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court
This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles
The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench
In the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices
Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the Alabama State Board of Education
In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years
The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012
Only three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise
The three GOP lieutenant governors are Steve Windom (1999–2003), Kay Ivey (2011–2017), and Will Ainsworth (2019–present)

Many local offices (county commissioners, boards of education, tax assessors, tax collectors, etc.)
in the state are still held by Democrats
Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary
Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions
Alabama's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, at-large races, and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts
The current split is 35 Democrats, 31 Republicans, and one Independent Fayette
However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties
The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties
, the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in Morgan County, Alabama, and ten African-American sheriffs

The state's two U.S. senators are Republican Richard C. Shelby and Democrat Doug Jones
Shelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties immediately following the November 1994 general election
In the U.S. House of Representatives, the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: (Bradley Byrne, Mike D. Rogers, Robert Aderholt, Morris J. Brooks, Martha Roby, and Gary Palmer) and one Democrat: Terri Sewell who represents the Black Belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of Birmingham, Tuscaloosa and Montgomery

That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year
In 2007, over 82&nbsp;percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National No Child Left Behind law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama
While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states
According to U.S. Census data (2000), Alabama's high school graduation rate (75%) is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi)
The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees
Although unusual in the West, school corporal punishment is not uncommon in Alabama, with 27,260 public school students paddled at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year
The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed only by Mississippi and Arkansas

Alabama's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities

In Greek mythology, Achilles or Achilleus ( ; Ἀχιλλεύς, Achilleus ) was a hero of the Trojan War, the greatest of all the Greek warriors, and is the central character of Homer's Iliad
He was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus, king of Phthia
Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan prince Hector outside the gates of Troy
Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad, other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him in the heel with an arrow
Later legends (beginning with Statius' unfinished epic Achilleid, written in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel because, when his mother Thetis dipped him in the river Styx as an infant, she held him by one of his heels
Alluding to these legends, the term "Achilles' heel" has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution
The Achilles tendon is also named after him due to these legends

Linear B tablets attest to the personal name Achilleus in the forms a-ki-re-u and a-ki-re-we, the latter being the dative of the former
The name grew more popular, even becoming common soon after the seventh century BC and was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία (Achilleía), attested in Attica in the fourth century BC (IG II² 1617) and, in the form Achillia, on a stele in Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an "Amazon"
Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of ἄχος () "distress, pain, sorrow, grief" and λαός () "people, soldiers, nation", resulting in a proto-form *Akhí-lāu̯os "he who has the people distressed" or "he whose people have distress"
The grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the Iliad (and frequently by Achilles himself)
Achilles' role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of κλέος  ("glory", usually in war)
Furthermore, laós has been construed by Gregory Nagy, following Leonard Palmer, to mean "a corps of soldiers", a muster
With this derivation, the name obtains a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring distress to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war
The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership
Another etymology relates the name to a Proto-Indo-European compound *h₂eḱ-pṓds "sharp foot" which first gave an Illyrian *āk̂pediós, evolving through time into *ākhpdeós and then *akhiddeús
The shift from -dd- to -ll- is then ascribed to the passing of the name into Greek via a Pre-Greek source
The first root part *h₂eḱ- "sharp, pointed" also gave Greek ἀκή (akḗ "point, silence, healing"), ἀκμή (akmḗ "point, edge, zenith") and ὀξύς (oxús "sharp, pointed, keen, quick, clever"), whereas ἄχος stems from the root *h₂egʰ- "to be upset, afraid"
The whole expression would be comparable to the Latin acupedius "swift of foot"
Compare also the Latin word family of aciēs "sharp edge or point, battle line, battle, engagement", acus "needle, pin, bodkin", and acuō "to make pointed, sharpen, whet; to exercise; to arouse" (whence acute)
Some topical epitheta of Achilles in the Iliad point to this "swift-footedness", namely ποδάρκης δῖος Ἀχιλλεὺς (podárkēs dĩos Achilleús "swift-footed divine Achilles") or, even more frequently, πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς (pódas ōkús Achilleús "quick-footed Achilles")
Some researchers deem the name a loan word, possibly from a Pre-Greek language
Achilles' descent from the Nereid Thetis and a similarity of his name with those of river deities such as Acheron and Achelous have led to speculations about him being an old water divinity (see below Worship)
Robert S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name, based among other things on the coexistence of -λλ- and -λ- in epic language, which may account for a palatalized phoneme /ly/ in the original language

Achilles was the son of the Nereid Thetis and of Peleus, the king of the Myrmidons
Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy (originally uttered by Themis, goddess of divine law) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father
For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus
There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: In the Argonautica (4.760) Zeus' sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods
Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus
Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal
According to the Achilleid, written by Statius in the 1st century AD, and to non-surviving previous sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river Styx; however, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel  (see Achilles' heel, Achilles' tendon)
It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier
In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body
She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage
None of the sources before Statius make any reference to this general invulnerability
To the contrary, in the Iliad Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the Paeonian hero Asteropaeus, son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander
He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, "drawing a spurt of blood"
Also, in the fragmentary poems of the Epic Cycle in which one can find description of the hero's death (i.e the Cypria, the Little Iliad by Lesches of Pyrrha, the Aithiopis and Iliou persis by Arctinus of Miletus), there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel; in the later vase paintings presenting the death of Achilles, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his torso
Peleus entrusted Achilles to Chiron the Centaur, on Mount Pelion, to be reared
Thetis foretold that her son's fate was either to gain glory and die young, or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity
Achilles chose the former, and decided to take part in the Trojan war
According to Homer, Achilles grew up in Phthia together with his companion Patroclus
According to Photius, the sixth book of the New History by Ptolemy Hephaestion reported that Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus; but when she had Achilles, Peleus noticed, tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot, and confided him to the centaur Chiron
Later Chiron exhumed the body of the Damysus, who was the fastest of all the giants, removed the ankle, and incorporated it into Achilles' burnt foot

Among the appellations under which Achilles is generally known are the following:
Pyrisous, "saved from the fire", his first name, which seems to favour the tradition in which his mortal parts were burned by his mother Thetis
Aeacides, from his grandfather Aeacus
Aemonius, from Aemonia, a country which afterwards acquired the name of Thessaly
Aspetos, "inimitable" or "vast", his name at Epirus
Larissaeus, from Larissa (also called Cremaste), a town of Thessaly, which still bears the same name
Ligyron, his original name
Nereius, from his mother Thetis, one of the Nereids
Pelides, from his father, Peleus
Phthius, from his birthplace, Phthia

Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hid the young man at the court of Lycomedes, king of Skyros
There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name "Pyrrha" (the red-haired girl)
With Lycomedes' daughter Deidamia, whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, Neoptolemus (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias)
According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet Calchas that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid
Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewellery and places a shield and spear among his goods
When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign
In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away

According to the Iliad, Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 Myrmidons
He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, Eudorus, Peisander, Phoenix and Alcimedon

When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in Mysia, ruled by King Telephus
In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that "he that wounded shall heal"
Guided by the oracle, he arrived at Argos, where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy
According to other reports in Euripides' lost play about Telephus, he went to Aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound
Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge
Alternatively, Telephus held Orestes for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound
Odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it
Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed

According to the Cypria (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' wrath), when the Achaeans desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas, sacked neighbouring cities (like Pedasus and Lyrnessus, where the Greeks capture the queen Briseis) and killed Tenes, a son of Apollo, as well as Priam's son Troilus in the sanctuary of Apollo Thymbraios; however, the romance between Troilus and Chryseis described in Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde and in William Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida is a medieval invention
In Dares Phrygius' Account of the Destruction of Troy, the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, as well as in older accounts, Troilus was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King Priam's and Hecuba's five legitimate sons (or according other sources, another son of Apollo)
Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders, a "horse fighter" or "chariot fighter" according to Homer
Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him
Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister Polyxena, and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth&nbsp;– who, refusing to yield, instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo Thymbraios
Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace
In this version of the myth, Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege
Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents
Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the First Vatican Mythographer claimed, Troy would have been invincible; however, the motif is older and found already in Plautus' Bacchides

Homer's Iliad is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War
Achilles' wrath (μῆνις Ἀχιλλέως, mênis Achilléōs) is the central theme of the poem
The first two lines of the Iliad read:
The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war, and does not narrate Achilles' death
It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by Agamemnon, the commander of the Achaean forces
Agamemnon has taken a woman named Chryseis as his slave
Her father Chryses, a priest of Apollo, begs Agamemnon to return her to him
Agamemnon refuses, and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks
The prophet Calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him
Achilles does so, and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father
Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles' battle prize Briseis, the daughter of Briseus, be brought to him to replace Chryseis
Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis), with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces
At the same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honour
As the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, Nestor declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior
Agamemnon agrees and sends Odysseus and two other chieftains, Ajax and Phoenix, to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts
Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do
The Trojans, led by Hector, subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships
With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, Patroclus leads the Myrmidons into battle, wearing Achilles' armour, though Achilles remains at his camp
Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy
After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from Antilochus, the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion's death
His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles
She persuades Hephaestus to make new armour for him, in place of the armour that Patroclus had been wearing, which was taken by Hector
The new armour includes the Shield of Achilles, described in great detail in the poem
Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field, killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector
Achilles even engages in battle with the river god Scamander, who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed
The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by Hera and Hephaestus
Zeus himself takes note of Achilles' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself
Finally, Achilles finds his prey
Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before Athena, in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, Deiphobus, persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face
After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable
Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses
Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him
Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that "my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me"
Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot
After having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral, Achilles hosts a series of funeral games in his honour
At the onset of his duel with Hector, Achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky, which comes on in the autumn, Orion's dog (Sirius); a sign of evil
During the cremation of Patroclus, he is compared to Hesperus, the evening/western star (Venus), while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until Phosphorus, the morning/eastern star (also Venus) has set (descended)
With the assistance of the god Hermes (Argeiphontes), Hector's father Priam goes to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector's body so that he can be buried
Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral, lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th (in the tradition of Niobe's offspring)
The poem ends with a description of Hector's funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come

The Aethiopis (7th century BC) and a work named Posthomerica, composed by Quintus of Smyrna in the fourth century AD, relate further events from the Trojan War
When Penthesilea, queen of the Amazons and daughter of Ares, arrives in Troy, Priam hopes that she will defeat Achilles
After his temporary truce with Priam, Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen, only to grieve over her death later
At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual
Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her
Following the death of Patroclus, Nestor's son Antilochus becomes Achilles' closest companion
When Memnon, son of the Dawn Goddess Eos and king of Ethiopia, slays Antilochus, Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon
Consequently, Eos will not let the sun rise, until Zeus persuades her
The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess
Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the Iliad's description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it
The episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic Aethiopis, which was composed after the Iliad, possibly in the 7th century BC
The Aethiopis is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors

The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times
In the Iliad, it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship
Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were lovers
Despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors
Commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures
In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the Greek custom of paiderasteia
In Plato's Symposium, the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover
But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish [and

Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865
Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis
He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy
Born in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family
Self-educated, he became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator and Congressman
In 1849, he left government to resume his law practice, but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854
He became a leader in the new [of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party] and gained national attention in 1858 for debating national Democratic leader Stephen A. Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate campaign
He then ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North and winning
Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the constitutional rights of Southern states to practice slavery
They began the process of seceding from the union
To secure its independence, the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter, one of the few U.S. forts in the South
Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union
As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the South; War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination
Lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people
His Gettysburg Address became an iconic call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy
He suspended [corpus], and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair
Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade that shut down the South's trade
As the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; ordering the Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraging border states to outlaw slavery, and pushing through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country
Lincoln managed his own re-election campaign
He sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists
A few days after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, he was shot by John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, on April 14, 1865, and died the following day
Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the United States' martyr hero
He is consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest U.S. presidents

Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, as the second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln, in a one-room log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky
He was a descendant of Samuel Lincoln, an Englishman who migrated from Hingham, Norfolk, to its namesake, Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1638
Samuel's grandson and great-grandson began the family's westward migration, passing through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia
Lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake, Captain Abraham Lincoln, moved the family from Virginia to Jefferson County, Kentucky, in the 1780s
Captain Lincoln was killed in an Indian raid in 1786
His children, including eight-year-old Thomas, Abraham's father, witnessed the attack
Thomas then worked at odd jobs in Kentucky and in Tennessee, before settling with members of his family in Hardin County, Kentucky, in the early 1800s
Lincoln's mother, Nancy, is widely assumed to have been the daughter of Lucy Hanks, although no record documents this
Thomas and Nancy married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to Elizabethtown, Kentucky
They produced three children: Sarah, born on February 10, 1807; Abraham, on February 12, 1809; and Thomas, who died in infancy
Thomas Lincoln bought or leased farms in Kentucky
Thomas became embroiled in legal disputes, and lost all but  of his land in court disputes over property titles
In 1816, the family moved to Indiana, where the survey process was more reliable and land titles were more secure
Indiana was a "free" (non-slaveholding) territory, and they settled in an "unbroken forest" in Hurricane Township, Perry County
(Their land became part of Spencer County, Indiana, when the county was established in 1818.)
In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was "partly on account of slavery", but mainly due to land title difficulties
In Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter
He owned farms, town lots and livestock, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners
Thomas and Nancy were members of a Separate Baptists church, which forbade alcohol, dancing, and slavery
Overcoming financial challenges, Thomas eventually obtained clear title to  of land in what became known as the Little Pigeon Creek Community

On October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln died of milk sickness, leaving 11-year-old Sarah in charge of a household that included her father, 9-year-old Abraham, and Dennis Hanks, Nancy's 19-year-old orphaned cousin
Ten years later, on January 20, 1828, Sarah died while giving birth to a stillborn son
Lincoln was very distraught over his sister's death
On December 2, 1819, Thomas married Sarah "Sally" Bush Johnston, a widow from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, with three children of her own
Abraham became close to his stepmother, whom he referred to as "Mother"
Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with farm life
He was called lazy for all his "reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing Poetry, etc."
His stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy "physical labor", but loved to read

Lincoln was largely self-educated
His formal schooling (from travelling teachers) was intermittent, totaling less than 12 months; however, he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning
Family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that he read and reread the King James Bible, Aesop's Fables, John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, Mason Locke Weems's The Life of Washington, and The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, among others
Teenaged Lincoln took responsibility for chores
He accepted the customary practice that a son give his father all earnings from work outside the home until age 21
Lincoln became adept at using an axe
Tall for his age, Lincoln was strong and athletic
He became known for his strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as "the Clary's Grove boys"

In early March 1830, partly out of fear of a milk sickness outbreak, several members of the extended Lincoln family moved west to Illinois, a free state, and settled in Macon County,  west of Decatur
Historians disagree on who initiated the move; Thomas Lincoln had no obvious reason to do so
One possibility is that other members of the family, including Dennis Hanks, might not have matched Thomas's stability and steady income
After the family relocated to Illinois, Abraham became increasingly distant from Thomas, in part because of his father's lack of education, although occasionally lending him money
In 1831, as Thomas and other family prepared to move to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, Abraham left home
He lived in New Salem for six years
Lincoln and some friends took goods by flatboat to New Orleans, where he witnessed slavery firsthand

According to some sources, Lincoln's first romantic interest was Ann Rutledge, whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; these sources indicate that by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged
She died on August 25, 1835, most likely of typhoid fever
In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky
Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Owens if she returned to New Salem
Owens arrived in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts
On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Owens a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship
She never replied
In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to Mary Todd, a daughter of Robert Smith Todd, a wealthy slave-owner in Lexington, Kentucky
They met in Springfield, Illinois in December 1839 and were engaged a year later
A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled at Lincoln's initiative
They reconciled and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister
While anxiously preparing for the nuptials, Lincoln was asked where he was going and replied, "To hell, I suppose."
In 1844, the couple bought a house in Springfield near Lincoln's law office
Mary kept house, often with the help of a relative or hired servant
He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children
Robert Todd Lincoln was born in 1843 and Edward Baker Lincoln (Eddie) in 1846
Edward died on February 1, 1850, in Springfield, probably of tuberculosis
"Willie" Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever on February 20, 1862
The Lincolns' fourth son, Thomas "Tad" Lincoln, was born on April 4, 1853, and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16, 1871
Robert reached adulthood and produced children
The Lincolns' last descendant, great-grandson Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith, died in 1985
Lincoln "was remarkably fond of children", and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own
In fact, Lincoln's law partner William H. Herndon would grow irritated when Lincoln would bring his children to the law office
Their father, it seemed, was often too absorbed in his own work to notice his children's behaviour
Herndon recounted, "I have felt many and many a time that I wanted to wring their little necks, and yet out of respect for Lincoln I kept my mouth shut
Lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done."
The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents
Abraham suffered from "[of depression|melancholy]", a condition later referred to as clinical depression
Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875
Lincoln's father-in-law and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders
Lincoln was close to the Todds, and he and his family occasionally visited them
Mary cooked for Lincoln often during his presidency
Raised by a wealthy family, her cooking was simple, but satisfied Lincoln's tastes, which included imported oysters

In 1832, Lincoln and partner Denton Offutt bought a general store on credit in New Salem, Illinois
Although the economy was booming, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share
That March he entered politics, running for the Illinois General Assembly, advocating navigational improvements on the Sangamon River
He could draw crowds as a raconteur, but he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money and lost the election
Lincoln interrupted his campaign to briefly serve as a captain in the Illinois Militia (during the Black Hawk War)
He then returned to his campaign
At his first speech, he observed a supporter in the crowd under attack, grabbed the assailant by his "neck and the seat of his trousers" and tossed him
Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct
Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, all the while reading voraciously
He decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England and other law books
Of his learning method, Lincoln stated: "I studied with nobody"

His second state legislature campaign in 1834 was successful
Although he ran as a Whig, many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent
Lincoln served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a Whig from Sangamon County
He supported the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, later serving as a Canal Commissioner
In the 1835–36 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males
He was known for his "free soil" stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism
He first articulated this in 1837, saying, "[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils."
He followed Henry Clay in supporting the American Colonization Society program of advocating abolition and helping freed slaves to settle in Liberia
Admitted to the Illinois bar in 1836, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, and began to practice law under John T. Stuart, Mary Todd's cousin
Lincoln developed a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments
He partnered with Stephen T. Logan from 1841 until 1844
Then Lincoln began his practice with William Herndon, whom Lincoln thought "a studious young man"

From the early 1830s, Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be "an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay"
The party, including Lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads, and urbanization
Lincoln ran for the Whig nomination for Illinois's 7th district of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1843, but was defeated by John J. Hardin
However, Lincoln won support for the principle of rotation, whereby Hardin would retire after only one term
Lincoln hoped that this arrangement would lead to his nomination in 1846
Lincoln was indeed elected to the House of Representatives in 1846, where he served one two-year term
He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, showing party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line
Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R. Giddings, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter
He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters

Committee on Post Office and Post Roads
Committee on Expenditures in the War Department

On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke out against the Mexican–American War, which he attributed to President James K. Polk's desire for "military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood"
Lincoln supported the Wilmot Proviso, which if passed would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico
Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his Spot Resolutions
The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico, and Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had "invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil"
Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil
Congress neither debated nor enacted the resolution, the national papers ignored it, and it cost Lincoln political support in his district
One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him "spotty Lincoln"
Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on presidential war-making powers
Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, Lincoln, who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House, supported General Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election
Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the General Land Office, but lost out
The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory
This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice

Lincoln practiced law in Springfield, handling "every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer"
Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session
Lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges
As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him
He later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge
In 1849, he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water
The idea was never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent
In 1851, he represented the Alton & Sangamon Railroad in a dispute with shareholder James A. Barret, who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route
Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer, superior, and less expensive route, and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret's payment
The decision by the Illinois Supreme Court was cited by many other courts
Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor
From 1853 to 1860, another of Lincoln's largest clients was the Illinois Central Railroad
Lincoln's legal reputation gave rise to his nickname "Honest Abe"
Lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended William "Duff" Armstrong, who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker
The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness
After an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers' Almanac showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility
Armstrong was acquitted
Lincoln rarely raised objections; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, who was accused of killing a man, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client
Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison

The debate over the status of slavery in the territories exacerbated sectional tensions between the slave-holding South and the free North
The Compromise of 1850 failed to defuse the issue
In the early 1850s, Lincoln supported sectional mediation, and his 1852 eulogy for Clay focused on the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to "both extremes" on the slavery issue
As the 1850s progressed, the debate over slavery in the Nebraska Territory and Kansas Territory became particularly acrimonious, and Senator Douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise measure; the proposal would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery
The proposal alarmed many Northerners, who hoped to prevent the spread of slavery into the territories
Despite this Northern opposition, Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act narrowly passed Congress in May 1854
For months after its passage, Lincoln did not publicly comment, but he came to strongly oppose it
On October 16, 1854, in his "Peoria Speech", Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency
Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a powerful voice, he said the Kansas Act had a "declared indifference, but as I must think, a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery
I cannot but hate it
I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself
I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world&nbsp;..." Lincoln's attacks on the Kansas–Nebraska Act marked his return to political life
Nationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue
Reflecting the demise of his party, Lincoln wrote in 1855, "I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist [...] I do no more than oppose the extension of slavery."
Drawing on the antislavery portion of the Whig Party, and combining Free Soil, Liberty, and antislavery Democratic Party members, the new Republican Party formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery
Lincoln resisted early recruiting attempts, fearing that it would serve as a platform for extreme abolitionists
Lincoln hoped to rejuvenate the Whigs, though he lamented his party's growing closeness with the nativist Know Nothing movement
In the 1854 elections, Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature but declined to take his seat
In the elections' aftermath, which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, Lincoln instead sought election to the United States Senate
At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature
After leading in the first six rounds of voting, he was unable to obtain a majority
Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull
Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig
Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, Joel Aldrich Matteson

In part due to the ongoing violent political confrontations in Kansas, opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act remained strong throughout the North
As the 1856 elections approached, Lincoln joined the Republicans
He attended the May 1856 Bloomington Convention, which formally established the Illinois Republican Party
The convention platform asserted that Congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state
Lincoln gave the final speech of the convention, in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union
At the June 1856 Republican National Convention, Lincoln received significant support to run for vice president, though the party nominated William Dayton to run with John C. Frémont
Lincoln supported the Republican ticket, campaigning throughout Illinois
The Democrats nominated former Ambassador James Buchanan, who had been out of the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the slavery debate, while the Know Nothings nominated former Whig President Millard Fillmore
Buchanan defeated both his challengers
Republican William Henry Bissell won election as Governor of Illinois
Lincoln's vigorous campaigning had made him the leading Republican in Illinois

Eric Foner (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast, who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans, who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress
Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence

In March 1857, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney wrote that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution
While many Democrats hoped that Dred Scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North
Lincoln denounced it, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power
Lincoln argued, "The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'."

Douglas was up for re-election in 1858, and Lincoln hoped to defeat him
With the former Democrat Trumbull now serving as a Republican senator, many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and willingness to support Trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor
Some eastern Republicans favored Douglas's re-election in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state
Many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference
For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition
Accepting the nomination, Lincoln delivered his House Divided Speech, drawing on , "A house divided against itself cannot stand
I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free
I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided
It will become all one thing, or all the other."
The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion
The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas
When informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated, "[Lincoln] is the strong man of the party&nbsp;... and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won."
The Senate campaign featured seven debates, the most famous political debates in American history
The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically
Lincoln warned that "The Slave Power" was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that all men are created equal, while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists
The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands
Lincoln's argument was rooted in morality
He claimed that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states
Douglas's argument was legal, claiming that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision
Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas
Lincoln's articulation of the issues gave him a national political presence
In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats-Anzeiger, a German-language newspaper that was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but the German-language paper mobilized Republican support
In the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate, rivaled by William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Simon Cameron
While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast, and was unsure whether to seek the office
In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed his candidacy
On February 27, 1860, New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union to a group of powerful Republicans
Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery
Lincoln insisted that morality required opposition to slavery, and rejected any "groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong"
Despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly—Lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership that brought him into contention
Journalist Noah Brooks reported, "No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience."
Historian David Herbert Donald described the speech as a "superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's (Seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (Chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery"
In response to an inquiry about his ambitions, Lincoln said, "The taste is in my mouth a little."

On May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur
Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis, Norman Judd, Leonard Swett, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement
Exploiting his embellished frontier legend (clearing land and splitting fence rails), Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of "The Rail Candidate"
In 1860, Lincoln described himself: "I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes."
On May 18, at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase
A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket
Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the tariff
Pennsylvania put him over the top, led by Pennsylvania iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support
Lincoln's managers had focused on this delegation, while following Lincoln's dictate to "Make no contracts that bind me"
Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party, as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government
Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession
Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats
Delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the Democratic convention, disagreeing with Douglas's position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge as their candidate
A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the Constitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell of Tennessee
Lincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North, while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South
Lincoln's campaign team carefully projected his image as an ideal candidate
Michael Martinez wrote:
Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the Wide Awakes, which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties
Lincoln's ideas of abolishing slavery grew, drawing more supporters
People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln and rallied supporters for Lincoln
As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln was the only one to give no speeches
Instead, he relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party
The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials
Thousands of Republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty
The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of "free labor", whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts
The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000–200,000 copies
On November 6, Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States
He was the first Republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the North and West; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states
Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the total in a four-way race
He won the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon
Lincoln's victory in the electoral college was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123

After the November election, secessionists planned to leave the Union before he took office in March
On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas had followed
Six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the Confederate States of America and adopted a constitution
The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal
President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal
The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional President on February 9, 1861
Attempts at compromise followed
Lincoln and the Republicans rejected the proposed Crittenden Compromise as contrary to the Party's free-soil in the territories platform
Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, "I will suffer death before I consent&nbsp;... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right."
Lincoln did tacitly support the proposed Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states
That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed
A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution
Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution
En route to his inauguration, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North
The president-elect evaded possible assassins in Baltimore
On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard
Lincoln directed his inaugural address to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the Southern states:
Lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between North and South, stating "One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended
This is the only substantial dispute."
The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: "We are not enemies, but friends
We must not be enemies&nbsp;..
The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."
The failure of the Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible
By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms
Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated
Lincoln said in his second inaugural address:

Fort Sumter's commander, Major Robert Anderson, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war
On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter and began the fight
Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion
William Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was "sadly disappointed" at his failure to realize that "the country was sleeping on a volcano" and that the South was preparing for war
Donald concludes that, "His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood
But he also vowed not to surrender the forts
The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that."
On April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and "preserve the Union", which, in his view, remained intact despite the seceding states
This call forced states to choose sides
Virginia seceded and was rewarded with the Confederate capital, despite the exposed position of Richmond close to Union lines
North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas followed over the following two months
Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky remained neutral
The Fort Sumter attack rallied Americans north of the Mason-Dixon line to defend the nation
States sent Union regiments south
On April 19, mobs in Baltimore, which controlled rail links, attacked Union troops who were changing trains
Local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital
The Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials
Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington
John Merryman, a Maryland official involved in hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander, Roger B. Taney, author of the Dred Scott opinion, to issue a writ of habeas corpus
In June Taney, acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the Supreme Court, issued the writ, because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ
Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the ex parte Merryman ruling

After the Battle of Fort Sumter, Lincoln took executive control of the war and formed an overall Union military strategy
Lincoln responded to this unprecedented political and military crisis as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers
He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended habeas corpus, and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers
Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions
In addition, Lincoln had to reinforce Union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict
The war dominated Lincoln's time and attention
From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success, and that any compromise would alienate factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions
Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery
The Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery
On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederates
In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery
In late August 1861, General John C. Frémont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, without consulting his superiors in Washington, proclaimed a very harsh martial law in Missouri
Lincoln cancelled the proclamation, saying its emancipation plan was political, lacking military necessity and a legal basis
After Lincoln acted, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000
In foreign policy, Lincoln's main goal was to stop military aid to the Confederacy
Lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward
At times Seward was too bellicose, so for balance Lincoln maintained a close working relationship with Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Charles Sumner
The Trent Affair of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain
The U.S. Navy had illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the Trent, on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered
Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats
Biographer James G. Randall dissected Lincoln's successful techniques:
Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into War Department
He tracked all phases of the effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their success (as well as their state and party)
In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced Simon Cameron with Edwin Stanton as War Secretary
Stanton centralized the War Department's activities, auditing and cancelling contracts, saving the federal government $17,000,000
Stanton was a staunchly Unionist, pro-business, conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction
He worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official
"Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together," say Thomas and Hyman
In terms of war strategy, Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort leading to prompt, decisive victory
However major Northern newspapers demanded more—they expected victory within 90 days
Twice a week, Lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon
Occasionally Mary would force him to take a carriage ride, concerned that he was working too hard
Lincoln learned from reading his chief of staff General Henry Halleck's book, a disciple of the European strategist Jomini; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River
Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory

After the Union rout at Bull Run and Winfield Scott's retirement, Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general-in-chief
McClellan then took months to plan his Peninsula Campaign
McClellan's slow progress frustrated Lincoln, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington
McClellan blamed Lincoln's holding troops back for his campaign's subsequent failure
Lincoln went as far as meeting with General McClellan in his home to discuss matters privately
Once McClellan heard Lincoln was in his home, McClellan stayed hidden away until Lincoln left
Lincoln removed McClellan in March 1862, after McClellan offered unsolicited political advice
In July Lincoln elevated Henry Halleck
Lincoln appointed John Pope as head of the new Army of Virginia
Pope complied with Lincoln's desire to advance on Richmond from the north, thus protecting Washington from counterattack
Pope was then soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac back to defend Washington
Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln restored him to command of all forces around Washington
Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September
The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January
Lincoln had waited for a military victory so that the Proclamation would not be perceived as the product of desperation
McClellan then resisted the president's demand that he pursue Lee's army, while General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee
Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, replaced McClellan with Ambrose Burnside
Both were presumably more supportive of the commander-in-chief
Burnside, against presidential advice, launched an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December
Desertions during 1863 came in the thousands and increased after Fredericksburg
Lincoln promoted Joseph Hooker
The midterm elections in 1862 cost the Republicans severe losses due to rising inflation, high taxes, rumors of corruption, suspension of habeas corpus, military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would come North and undermine the labor market
The Emancipation Proclamation gained votes for Republicans in rural New England and the upper Midwest, but cost votes in the Irish and German strongholds and in the lower Midwest, where many Southerners had lived for generations
In the spring of 1863, Lincoln became optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included attacks by Hooker on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans on Chattanooga, Grant on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston
Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May
He then resigned and was replaced by George Meade as Lee moved north
Meade followed Lee into Pennsylvania and beat him in the Gettysburg Campaign, but then failed to follow up despite Lincoln's demands
At the same time, Grant captured Vicksburg and gained control of the Mississippi River, splitting off the far western rebel states

The Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states
Lincoln argued that slavery would end by preventing its expansion into new territories
He sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery
Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery would make it obsolete
Lincoln rejected Fremont's two emancipation attempts in August 1861 and one by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and would upset loyal border states
On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory
In July, the Confiscation Act of 1862 was enacted, which set up court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion
Although Lincoln believed this was not within Congress's power, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature
He felt such action could be taken only by the Commander-in-Chief, using Constitutional war powers, which he planned to do
Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet
Privately, Lincoln concluded that the Confederacy's slave base had to be eliminated
However, Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification
Republican editor Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune agreed
Lincoln rejected this argument directly in his letter of August 22, 1862
Although he said he personally wished all men could be free, Lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his "official duty") was that of preserving the Union:
The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, with effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas under Union control in two states
Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites
Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, Union armies advancing south liberated three million slaves
Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper."
Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves
He supported this in the Proclamation, but the undertaking failed
Enlisting former slaves became official policy
By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers
In a letter to Tennessee military governor Andrew Johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, "The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once"
By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley

Lincoln spoke at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863
Defying his prediction that "the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here", the Address became the most quoted speech in American history
In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal"
He defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all
He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end, and the future of democracy would be assured, that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth"

Grant's victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln
Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, "I can't spare this man
He fights."
With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could advance in multiple theaters, and incorporate black troops
Meade's failure to capture Lee's army after Gettysburg and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to promote Grant to supreme commander
Grant stayed with Meade's army and told Meade what to do
Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in 1864, as was McClellan
Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to inquire into Grant's political intentions
Assured that he had none, Lincoln submitted Grant's appointment to the Senate
He obtained Congress's consent to make him Lieutenant General, a rank that had remained unoccupied since George Washington
Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864, with heavy losses on both sides
Despite this, when Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, the general replied, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer."
Grant's army moved steadily south
Lincoln traveled to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia to confer with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman
Lincoln replaced the Union losses by mobilizing support throughout the North
Lincoln authorized Grant to target infrastructure—plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its fighting ability
Lincoln emphasized defeat of the Confederate armies rather than destruction (which was considerable) for its own sake
In 1864 Confederate general Jubal Early raided Washington, D.C., while Lincoln watched from an exposed position; Captain Oliver Wendell Holmes shouted at him, "Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!"
As Grant continued to attrit Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began
Confederate Vice President Stephens led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at Hampton Roads
Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results
On April 1, 1865, Grant nearly encircled Petersburg
The Confederate government evacuated and the city fell
Lincoln visited the conquered capital
On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox officially ending the war

Lincoln ran again in 1864
He united the main Republican factions, along with War Democrats such as Edwin M. Stanton and Andrew Johnson
Lincoln used conversation and his patronage powers—greatly expanded from peacetime—to build support and fend off the Radicals' efforts to replace him
At its convention, the Republicans selected Johnson as his running mate
To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party
Grant's bloody stalemates damaged Lincoln's re-election prospects, and many Republicans feared defeat
Lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House: Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope
While the Democratic platform followed the "Peace wing" of the party and called the war a "failure", their candidate, McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform
Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and led his party to renew its support for Grant
Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and David Farragut's capture of Mobile ended defeatism
The Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln
The National Union Party was united by Lincoln's support for emancipation
State Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads
On November 8, Lincoln carried all but three states, including 78 percent of Union soldiers
On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address
In it, he deemed the endless casualties to be God's will
Historian Mark Noll claims this speech to rank "among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world"
Lincoln said:

Reconstruction began during the war, as Lincoln and his associates considered how to reintegrate the nation, and the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves
Shortly after Lee's surrender, a general asked Lincoln how to treat defeated Confederates
Lincoln replied, "Let 'em up easy."
Lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war even when it had passed, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states
His main goal was to keep the union together
He planned to go forward not by focusing on who to blame, but on how to rebuild the nation as one
Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radicals, under Rep. Thaddeus Stevens, Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. Benjamin Wade, who otherwise remained Lincoln's allies
Determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held
His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance
As Southern states fell, they needed leaders while their administrations re-formed
In Tennessee and Arkansas, Lincoln appointed Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively
In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed
Democratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations
The Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade–Davis Bill, in 1864, which Lincoln vetoed
The Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee
Lincoln's appointments were designed to harness both moderates and Radicals
To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the Radicals' choice, Salmon P. Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies
After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment
He declared that such an amendment would "clinch the whole matter"
By December 1863, an amendment was brought to Congress
This first attempt failed, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives
Passage became part of the Republican/Unionist platform
After a House debate, the second attempt passed on January 31, 1865
With ratification, it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865
Lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen
He signed Senator Charles Sumner's Freedmen's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves
The law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen
Lincoln announced a Reconstruction plan that involved short-term military control, pending readmission under the control of southern Unionists
Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly how Reconstruction would have proceeded had Lincoln lived
Biographers James G. Randall and Richard Current, according to David Lincove, argue that:
Eric Foner argues that:

Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, giving Congress primary responsibility for lawmaking while the Executive enforced them
Lincoln vetoed only four bills; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh Reconstruction program
The 1862 Homestead Act made millions of acres of Western government-held land available for purchase at low cost
The 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state
The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869
The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was enabled by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s
In July 1861, the US issued paper currency for the first time
The currency became known greenbacks, because it was printed in green on the reverse side
Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a Federal income tax
In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariffs, following the first enacted by Buchanan
Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income tax
This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms)
The Revenue Act of 1862 adopted rates that increased with income
Lincoln presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in other areas
The National Banking Act created the system of national banks
It also established a national currency
In 1862, Congress created the Department of Agriculture
In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope to put down the "Sioux Uprising" in Minnesota
Presented with 303 execution warrants for Santee Dakota who were convicted of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each warrant, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved)
In response to rumors of a renewed draft, the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market
Lincoln attacked the media about such behavior, ordering the military to seize the two papers
The seizure lasted for two days
Lincoln is largely responsible for the Thanksgiving holiday
Thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in New England in the 17th century
It had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates
The prior proclamation had been during James Madison's presidency 50 years earlier
In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving
In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park

Lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that "we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it
Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known."
Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court
Noah Haynes Swayne was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union
Samuel Freeman Miller, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist
David Davis was Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860 and had served as a judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit
Democrat Stephen Johnson Field, a previous California Supreme Court justice, provided geographic and political balance
Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, became Chief Justice
Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party

Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges, including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States, and 27 judges to the United States district courts
Lincoln appointed no judges to the United States circuit courts during his time in office

West Virginia was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863
Nevada, which became the third State in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on October 31, 1864

Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending a play at Ford's Theatre, five days after Lee's surrender
Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service
After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, Booth decided to assassinate the President
Learning of Lincoln's intent to attend the play with Grant, Booth and his co-conspirators planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at the theater and to kill Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their respective homes
Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14
At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play
Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13&nbsp;pm, fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him
Lincoln's guest Major Henry Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped
Lincoln was taken across the street to Petersen House
After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22&nbsp;am on April 15
After death his face relaxed into a smile
Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages."
Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang
President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00&nbsp;am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death
Booth was tracked to a farm in Virginia
Refusing to surrender, he was shot on April 26

The late President lay in state, first in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21
The caskets containing Lincoln's body and the body of his son Willie traveled for three weeks on the Lincoln Special funeral train
The train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands
Many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing or in silent grief
Poet Walt Whitman composed When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln
African-Americans were especially moved; they had lost 'their Moses'
In a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war
Historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death

As a young man, Lincoln was a religious skeptic
Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants
He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife
He was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it
He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others
Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs
However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and by 1865 was expressing those beliefs in major speeches
In the 1840s, Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity, a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power
In the 1850s, Lincoln asserted his belief in "providence" in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence
With the death of his son Edward, Lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on God
The death of son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for solace
After Willie's death, Lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary
He wrote at this time that God "could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest
Yet the contest began
And having begun, He could give the final victory to either side any day
Yet the contest proceeds."
On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the Holy Land

Several claims have been made that Lincoln's health was declining before the assassination
These are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting
One such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder, MEN2b, which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma, mucosal neuromas and a Marfanoid appearance
Others simply claim he had Marfan syndrome, based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers, and the association of possible aortic regurgitation, which can cause bobbing of the head (DeMusset's sign)&nbsp;– based on blurring of Lincoln's head in photographs, which required long exposure times
Confirmation of this and other diseases could possibly be obtained via DNA analysis of a pillow case stained with Lincoln's blood, currently in possession of the Grand Army of the Republic Museum & Library in Philadelphia, but as of 2009, the museum refused to provide a sample for testing

The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country
The term "the United States" has historically been used, sometimes in the plural ("these United States"), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency
The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century
Historians such as Harry Jaffa, Herman Belz, John Diggins, Vernon Burton, and Eric Foner stress Lincoln's redefinition of republican values
As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the "sheet anchor" of republicanism
The Declaration's emphasis on equality and freedom for all, in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate
Regarding the 1860 Cooper Union speech, Diggins notes, "Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself."
He highlights the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms
Nevertheless, Lincoln justified the war via legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state
Burton argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the emancipated Freedmen
In Lincoln's first inaugural address, he explored the nature of democracy
He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints
He said "A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people."

In [rankings of Presidents of the United States|surveys of U.S. scholars ranking presidents] conducted since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often as number one
A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after George Washington
In presidential ranking polls conducted in the United States since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the top in the majority of polls
Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1
Lincoln; 2
Washington; and 3
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, although the order varies
President Lincoln's assassination left him a national martyr
He was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty
Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party
Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability
Historians have said he was "a classical liberal" in the 19th century sense
Allen C. Guelzo states that Lincoln was a
Lincoln became a favorite exemplar for liberal intellectuals across the world
Schwartz argues that Lincoln's American reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of America's most venerated heroes, even among white Southerners
The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C
In the New Deal era, liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state
In the Cold War years, Lincoln's image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by Communist regimes
By the 1970s, Lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage, his acting in terms of Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers
As a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, infrastructure improvements, and railroads, in opposition to the agrarian Democrats
William C. Harris found that Lincoln's "reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism"
James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation "in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform"
Randall concludes that, "he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders."
By the late 1960s, some African American intellectuals, led by Lerone Bennett Jr., rejected Lincoln's role as the Great Emancipator
Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968
He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks
Bennett argued that Lincoln opposed social equality, and proposed sending freed slaves to another country
Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day; and that he was a "moral visionary" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible
The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation
Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered "erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule" in the late 20th century
On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability, defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were "content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason"
In the 21st century, President Barack Obama named Lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using Lincoln's Bible for his inaugural ceremonies
Lincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood, almost always in a flattering light
Union nationalism, as envisioned by Lincoln, "helped lead America to the nationalism of Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt."

Lincoln's portrait appears on two denominations of United States currency, the penny and the $5 bill
His likeness also appears on many postage stamps and he has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names, including the capital of Nebraska
While he is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell
The most famous and most visited memorials are Lincoln's sculpture on Mount Rushmore; Lincoln Memorial, Ford's Theatre, and Petersen House (where he died) in Washington, D.C.; and the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, not far from Lincoln's home, as well as his tomb
Sociologist Barry Schwartz argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with "a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life"
During the Great Depression, he argues, Lincoln served "as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful"
Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan
Americans asked, "What would Lincoln do?"
However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this "fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness"
He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept
The United States Navy   is named after Lincoln, the second Navy ship to bear his name

Aristotle (; Ἀριστοτέλης Aristotélēs, ; 384–322&nbsp;BC) was a Greek philosopher during the Classical period in Ancient Greece, the founder of the Lyceum and the Peripatetic school of philosophy and Aristotelian tradition
Along with his teacher Plato, he has been called the "Father of Western Philosophy"
His writings cover many subjects – including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics and government
Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him, and it was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry
As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion
Little is known about his life
Aristotle was born in the city of Stagira in Northern Greece
His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian
At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC)
Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC
He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls
Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication
Aristotle's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship
Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics
Some of Aristotle's zoological observations found in his biology, such as on the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were disbelieved until the 19th century
His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and John Buridan
Aristotle's influence on logic also continued well into the 19th century
He influenced Islamic thought during the Middle Ages, as well as Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church
Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as "The First Teacher" and among medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas as simply "The Philosopher"
His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics, such as in the thinking of  Alasdair MacIntyre and Philippa Foot

In general, the details of Aristotle's life are not well-established
The biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points
Aristotle, whose name means "the best purpose" in Ancient Greek, was born in 384&nbsp;BC in Stagira, Chalcidice, about 55&nbsp;km (34 miles) east of modern-day Thessaloniki
His father Nicomachus was the personal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon
Both of Aristotle's parents died when he was about thirteen, and Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian
Although little information about Aristotle's childhood has survived, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy
At the age of seventeen or eighteen, Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at Plato's Academy
He probably experienced the Eleusinian Mysteries as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the Eleusinian Mysteries, “to experience is to learn” [παθείν μαθεĩν]
Aristotle remained in Athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in 348/47&nbsp;BC
The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy's direction after control passed to Plato's nephew Speusippus, although it is possible that he feared the anti-Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died
Aristotle then accompanied Xenocrates to the court of his friend Hermias of Atarneus in Asia Minor
After the death of Hermias, Aristotle travelled with his pupil Theophrastus to the island of Lesbos, where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon
While in Lesbos, Aristotle married Pythias, either Hermias's adoptive daughter or niece
She bore him a daughter, whom they also named Pythias
In 343 BC, Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor to his son Alexander
Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of Macedon
During Aristotle's time in the Macedonian court, he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: Ptolemy and Cassander
Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and Aristotle's own attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric
In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be "a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants"
By 335&nbsp;BC, Aristotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the Lyceum
Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years
While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with Herpyllis of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, Nicomachus
According to the Suda, he also had an erômenos,  Palaephatus of Abydus
This period in Athens, between 335 and 323 BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works
He wrote many dialogues, of which only fragments have survived
Those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students
His most important treatises include Physics, Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, On the Soul and Poetics
Aristotle studied and made significant contributions to "logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance and theatre."
Near the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander's relationship with Persia and Persians
A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death
Following Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled
In 322&nbsp;BC, Demophilus and Eurymedon the Hierophant reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety, prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in  Chalcis, on Euboea, at which occasion he was said to have stated: "I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy" – a reference to Athens's trial and execution of Socrates
He died on Euboea of natural causes later that same year, having named his student Antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife
